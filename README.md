Playground for CI/CD reference architecture for Azure

Will be looking at patterns around using Azure with the following goals in mind:
   * CI/CD Pipeline
   * Infrastructure as Code
   * Moderately complex architecture
      * Polygot Data Access
      * Serverless Infrastructure
      * Security 'Better' Practices
      * Kubernetes / Elastic Scaling
      * API Gateway Pattern
      * Event Driven Architecture
      * React UI
      * Caching / Redis / HTTP Caching
      * Monitoring
      * Log Aggregation
